# Notes:
- The Bone Mill was being used by a group of Hags to make pies that were highly addictive.
- The flour for the pies was made using the ground up bones of children.
- The party killed the Hags and burnt the wind mill to the ground.
- No loot was found despite the fact that the hags were charging people a hefty price for the pies.
