# Notes:
- At this location was the Hag [[Morgantha]] and her two Hag daughters.  All three were able to cast 3, 3rd level spells.  This puts them at significant level above Brin. 
- While the Hags were clearly more powerful than Brin, he still believes [[Madam Eva]] to be significantly more powerful than the Hags.
- The Bone Mill was being used by a the Hags to make pies that were highly addictive.
- The flour for the pies was made using the ground up bones of children.
- The party killed the Hags and burnt the wind mill to the ground.
- No loot was found despite the fact that the hags were charging people a hefty price for the pies.
