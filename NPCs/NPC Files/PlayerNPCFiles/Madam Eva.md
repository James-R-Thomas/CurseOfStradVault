### Notes:

- Brin believes that Madam Eva is a very high level arcane spell caster.

Madam Eva gave the party a tarot card reading, here are the results:

	6 of Swords -- Berserker
	Find the Mad Dog's crypt. The treasure lies within, beneath blackened bones.

	5 of Glyphs -- Druid
	This card tells of a powerful force for good and protection, a holy symbol of great hope.
	An evil tree grows atop a hill of graves where the ancient dead sleep. The ravens can help you find it. Look for the treasure there.

	9 of Stars -- Conjurer
	This is a card of power and strength. It tells of a weapon of vengeance: a sword of sunlight.
	I see a dead village, drowned by a river, ruled by one who has brought great evil into the world.

	Donjon (King of Clubs)
	This card sheds light on one who will help you greatly in the battle against darkness.
	Find a girl driven to insanity, locked in the heart of her dead father's house. Curing her madness is key to your success.

	Innocent (Queen of Hearts)
	Your enemy is a creature of darkness, whose powers are beyond mortality. This card will lead you to him!
	He dwells with the one whose blood sealed his doom, a brother of light snuffed out too soon.
