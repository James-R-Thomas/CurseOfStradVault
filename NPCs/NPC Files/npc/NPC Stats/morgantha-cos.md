  - "desc": "A night hag carries two very rare magic items that she must craft for\
      \ herself. If either object is lost, the night hag will go to great lengths\
      \ to retrieve it, as creating a new tool takes time and effort.\n\nHeartstone:\
      \ This lustrous black gem allows a night hag to become ethereal while it is\
      \ in her possession. The touch of a heartstone also cures any disease. Crafting\
      \ a heartstone takes 30 days.\n\nSoul Bag: When an evil humanoid dies as a result\
      \ of a night hag's Nightmare Haunting, Morgantha catches the soul in this black\
      \ sack made of stitched flesh. A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at a time,\
      \ and only the night hag who crafted the bag can catch a soul with it. Crafting\
      \ a soul bag takes 7 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make\
      \ the bag)."

  - "desc": "Morgantha magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid,\
      \ or back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any\
      \ equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She reverts to her\
      \ true form if she dies."

    "name": "Etherealness"
  - "desc": "While on the Ethereal Plane, Morgantha magically touches a sleeping humanoid\
      \ on the Material Plane. A [protection from evil and good](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good-xphb.md)\
      \ spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As\
      \ long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions\
      \ last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its\
      \ hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (d10). If this effect reduces the target's\
      \ hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul\
      \ is trapped in Morgantha's soul bag. The reduction to the target's hit point\
      \ maximum lasts until removed by the  [greater restoration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration-xphb.md)\
      \ spell or similar magic."
