# [Guardian Portrait](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\construct/guardian-portrait-cos.md)
*Source: Curse of Strahd p. 227*  

A guardian portrait looks like a finely rendered and beautifully framed work of art, usually depicting someone important in a realistic manner. The picture and its frame are bound with powerful magic and are inseparable.

## Living Image

The eyes of the figure depicted in the painting are imbued with [darkvision](senses.md#Darkvision), and they appear to follow creatures that move in front of them.

## Innate Spells

When a guardian portrait attacks, the figure in the painting animates and moves as though alive (albeit in two dimensions). The guardian portrait has no effective melee attacks, but it has a repertoire of innate spells that it can cast. When it casts a spell, the figure painted on the canvas makes all the appropriate somatic gestures and verbal incantations for the spell.
