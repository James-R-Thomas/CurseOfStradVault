# Find Traps
*2nd-level, Divination*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You sense any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes any object or mechanism that was created to cause damage or other danger. Thus, the spell would sense the [Alarm](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/alarm-xphb.md) or [Glyph of Warding](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/glyph-of-warding-xphb.md) spell or a mechanical pit trap, but it wouldn't reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.

This spell reveals that a trap is present but not its location. You do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.

**Classes**: [Druid](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-divine-soul-xge.md "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB"); [Cleric](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Ranger](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-ranger.md); [Bard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Bard (College of Lore)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
