# Summon Celestial
*5th-level, Conjuration*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/summon-celestial.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a reliquary worth 500+ GP)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth a Celestial spirit. It manifests in an angelic form in an unoccupied space that you can see within range and uses the [Celestial Spirit](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/celestial-spirit-xphb.md) stat block. When you cast the spell, choose Avenger or Defender. Your choice determines certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 [Hit Points](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your [Initiative](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md) count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the [Dodge](actions.md#Dodge) action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.

**Classes**: [Warlock (Celestial Patron)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-celestial-patron-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-divine-soul-xge.md "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB"); [Cleric](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Paladin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin.md); [Bard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md)
