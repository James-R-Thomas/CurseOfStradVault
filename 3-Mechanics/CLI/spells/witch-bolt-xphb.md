# Witch Bolt
*1st-level, Evocation*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/witch-bolt.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a twig struck by lightning)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A beam of crackling energy lances toward a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target. Make a ranged spell attack against it. On a hit, the target takes `dice:2d12|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d12`) Lightning damage.

On each of your subsequent turns, you can take a [Bonus Action](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) to deal `dice:1d12|noform|noparens|avg` (`d12`) Lightning damage to the target automatically, even if the first attack missed.

The spell ends if the target is ever outside the spell's range or if it has Total [Cover](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cover-xphb.md) from you.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The initial damage increases by `dice:1d12|noform|noparens|avg|text(d12)` for each spell slot level above 1.
