# Identify
*1st-level, Divination (ritual)*  


- **Casting time:** 1 minute unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pearl worth 100+ GP)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch an object throughout the spell's casting. If the object is a magic item or some other magical object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires [Attunement](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/attunement-xphb.md), and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any ongoing spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn that spell's name.

If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn which ongoing spells, if any, are currently affecting it.
