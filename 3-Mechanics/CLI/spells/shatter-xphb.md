# Shatter
*2nd-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a chip of mica)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A loud noise erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius [Sphere](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered there makes a Constitution saving throw, taking `dice:3d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d8`) Thunder damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A Construct has [Disadvantage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on the save.

A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg|text(d8)` for each spell slot level above 2.
