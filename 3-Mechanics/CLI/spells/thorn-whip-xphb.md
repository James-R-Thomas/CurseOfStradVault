# Thorn Whip
*cantrip, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (the stem of a plant with thorns)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You create a vine-like whip covered in thorns that lashes out at your command toward a creature in range. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) Piercing damage, and if it is Large or smaller, you can pull it up to 10 feet closer to you.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases by `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`d6`) when you reach levels 5 (`dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`)), 11 (`dice:3d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d6`)), and 17 (`dice:4d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d6`)).

**Classes**: [Druid](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Artificer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-artificer.md); [Bard (College of Lore)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
