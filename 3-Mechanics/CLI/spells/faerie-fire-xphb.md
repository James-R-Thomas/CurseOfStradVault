Objects in a 20-foot [Cube](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) within range are outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Each creature in the [Cube](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) is also outlined if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed [Dim Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) in a 10-foot radius and can't benefit from the [Invisible](conditions.md#Invisible) condition.

[Attack](actions.md#Attack) rolls against an affected creature or object have [Advantage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) if the attacker can see it.
