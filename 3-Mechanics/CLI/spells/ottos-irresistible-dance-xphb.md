# Otto's Irresistible Dance
*6th-level, Enchantment*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

One creature that you can see within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the target dances comically until the end of its next turn, during which it must spend all its movement to dance in place.

On a failed save, the target has the [Charmed](conditions.md#Charmed) condition for the duration. While [Charmed](conditions.md#Charmed), the target dances comically, must use all its movement to dance in place, and has [Disadvantage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls, and other creatures have [Advantage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on attack rolls against it. On each of its turns, the target can take an action to collect itself and repeat the save, ending the spell on itself on a success.

**Classes**: [Cleric (Arcana Domain)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-arcana-domain-scag.md "subclass=SCAG;class=XPHB"); [Bard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Wizard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
