# Insect Plague
*5th-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a locust)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Swarming locusts fill a 20-foot-radius [Sphere](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on a point you choose within range. The [Sphere](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) remains for the duration, and its area is [Lightly Obscured](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/lightly-obscured-xphb.md) and [Difficult Terrain](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md).

When the swarm appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw, taking `dice:4d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d10`) Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature also makes this save when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `dice:1d10|noform|noparens|avg|text(d10)` for each spell slot level above 5.

**Classes**: [Druid](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Ranger (Swarmkeeper)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-swarmkeeper-tce.md "subclass=TCE;class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-divine-soul-xge.md "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB"); [Warlock (Fiend Patron)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-fiend-patron-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Cleric](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Druid (Circle of the Land)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-circle-of-the-land-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Bard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md)
