# Ray of Enfeeblement
*2nd-level, Necromancy*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A beam of enervating energy shoots from you toward a creature within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the target has [Disadvantage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on the next attack roll it makes until the start of your next turn.

On a failed save, the target has [Disadvantage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on Strength-based [D20 Tests](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/d20-test-xphb.md) for the duration. During that time, it also subtracts `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`d8`) from all its damage rolls. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on a success.
