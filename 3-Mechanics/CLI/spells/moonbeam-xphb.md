# Moonbeam
*2nd-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a moonseed leaf)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high [Cylinder](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, [Dim Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) fills the [Cylinder](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb.md), and you can take a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action on later turns to move the [Cylinder](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb.md) up to 60 feet.

When the [Cylinder](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb.md) appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:2d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d10`) Radiant damage, and if the creature is shape-shifted (as a result of the [Polymorph](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/polymorph-xphb.md) spell, for example), it reverts to its true form and can't shape-shift until it leaves the [Cylinder](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb.md). On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A creature also makes this save when the spell's area moves into its space and when it enters the spell's area or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `dice:1d10|noform|noparens|avg|text(d10)` for each spell slot level above 2.
