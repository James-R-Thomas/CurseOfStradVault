*1st-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of pork rind or butter)
- **Duration:** 1 minute

Nonflammable grease covers the ground in a 10-foot square centered on a point within range and turns it into [Difficult Terrain](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md) for the duration.

When the grease appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the [Prone](conditions.md#Prone) condition. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on that save or fall [Prone](conditions.md#Prone).
