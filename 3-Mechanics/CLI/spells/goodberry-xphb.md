# Goodberry
*1st-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a sprig of mistletoe)
- **Duration:** 24 hours

Ten berries appear in your hand and are infused with magic for the duration. A creature can take a [Bonus Action](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) to eat one berry. Eating a berry restores 1 [Hit Point](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md), and the berry provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day.

Uneaten berries disappear when the spell ends.

**Classes**: [Druid](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Ranger](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-ranger.md); [Bard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Bard (College of Lore)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
