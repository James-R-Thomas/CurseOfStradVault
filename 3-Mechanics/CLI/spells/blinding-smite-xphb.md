# Blinding Smite
*3rd-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 minute

The target hit by the strike takes an extra `dice:3d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d8`) Radiant damage from the attack, and the target has the [Blinded](conditions.md#Blinded) condition until the spell ends. At the end of each of its turns, the [Blinded](conditions.md#Blinded) target makes a Constitution saving throw, ending the spell on itself on a success.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The extra damage increases by `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg|text(d8)` for each spell slot level above 3.

**Classes**: [Paladin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin.md)
