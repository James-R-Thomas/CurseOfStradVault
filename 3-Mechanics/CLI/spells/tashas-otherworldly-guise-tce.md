# Tasha's Otherworldly Guise
*6th-level, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (an object engraved with a symbol of the Outer Planes, worth at least 500 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Uttering an incantation, you draw on the magic of the Lower Planes or Upper Planes (your choice) to transform yourself. You gain the following benefits until the spell ends:

- You are immune to fire and poison damage (Lower Planes) or radiant and necrotic damage (Upper Planes).  
- You are immune to the [poisoned](conditions.md#Poisoned) condition (Lower Planes) or the [charmed](conditions.md#Charmed) condition (Upper Planes).  
- Spectral wings appear on your back, giving you a flying speed of 40 feet.  
- You have a +2 bonus to AC.  
- All your weapon attacks are magical, and when you make a weapon attack, you can use your spellcasting ability modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.  
- You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the [Attack](actions.md#Attack) action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that lets you attack more than once when you take the Attack action on your turn.
