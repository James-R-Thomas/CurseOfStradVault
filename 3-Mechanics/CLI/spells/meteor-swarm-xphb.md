# Meteor Swarm
*9th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 1 miles
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius [Sphere](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on each of those points makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `dice:20d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`20d6`) Fire damage and `dice:20d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`20d6`) Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery [Sphere](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) is affected only once.

A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area, and the object starts [burning](/3-Mechanics/CLI/traps-hazards/burning-xphb.md) if it's flammable.
