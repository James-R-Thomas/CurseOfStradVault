Protective magical frost surrounds you. You gain 5 [Temporary Hit Points](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/temporary-hit-points-xphb.md). If a creature hits you with a melee attack roll before the spell ends, the creature takes 5 Cold damage. The spell ends early if you have no [Temporary Hit Points](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/temporary-hit-points-xphb.md).

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The [Temporary Hit Points](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/temporary-hit-points-xphb.md) and the Cold damage both increase by 5 for each spell slot level above 1.
