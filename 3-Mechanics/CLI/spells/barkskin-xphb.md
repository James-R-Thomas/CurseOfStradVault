You touch a willing creature. Until the spell ends, the target's skin assumes a bark-like appearance, and the target has an [Armor Class](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/armor-class-xphb.md) of 17 if its AC is lower than that.

**Classes**: [Druid](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Ranger](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-ranger.md); [Bard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Bard (College of Lore)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
