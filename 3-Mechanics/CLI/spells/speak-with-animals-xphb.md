# Speak with Animals
*1st-level, Divination (ritual)*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/speak-with-animals.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

For the duration, you can comprehend and verbally communicate with Beasts, and you can use any of the [Influence](actions.md#Influence) action's skill options with them.

Most Beasts have little to say about topics that don't pertain to survival or companionship, but at minimum, a Beast can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever it has perceived within the past day.
