*9th-level, Divination*  


- **Casting time:** 1 minute

- **Components:** V, S, M (a hummingbird feather)

You touch a willing creature and bestow a limited ability to see into the immediate future. For the duration, the target has [Advantage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on [D20 Tests](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/d20-test-xphb.md), and other creatures have [Disadvantage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on attack rolls against it. The spell ends early if you cast it again.
