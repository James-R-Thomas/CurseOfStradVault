# Yolande's Regal Presence
*5th-level, Enchantment*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/yolandes-regal-presence.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (10-foot Emanation)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a miniature tiara)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You surround yourself with unearthly majesty in a 10-foot [Emanation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md). Whenever the [Emanation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) enters the space of a creature you can see and whenever a creature you can see enters the [Emanation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) or ends its turn there, you can force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes `dice:4d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`4d6`) Psychic damage and has the [Prone](conditions.md#Prone) condition, and you can push it up to 10 feet away. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

**Classes**: [Bard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Paladin (Oath of Glory)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-oath-of-glory-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
