# Jakarion's Staff of Frost
*Staff, weapon, very rare (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*  


- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 bludgeoning
  - Two-handed: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [Versatile](item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

You have resistance to cold damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: [cone of cold](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/cone-of-cold-xphb.md) (5 charges), [fog cloud](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fog-cloud-xphb.md) (1 charge), [ice storm](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/ice-storm-xphb.md) (4 charges), or [wall of ice](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wall-of-ice-xphb.md) (4 charges).

The staff regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`d20`). On a 1. the staff turns to water and is destroyed.

Imprinted on this staff is a fragment of a dead wizard's personality. The first character who touches the staff gains the following flaw: "I crave power above all else, and will do anything to obtain more of it." This flaw trumps any conflicting personality trait.
