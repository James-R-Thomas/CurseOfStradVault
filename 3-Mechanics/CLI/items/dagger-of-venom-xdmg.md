You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

You can take a [Bonus Action](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) to magically coat the blade with poison. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take `dice:2d10|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d10`) Poison damage and have the [Poisoned](conditions.md#Poisoned) condition for 1 minute. The weapon can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
