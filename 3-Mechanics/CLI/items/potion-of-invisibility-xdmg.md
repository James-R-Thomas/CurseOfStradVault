# Potion of Invisibility
*Potion, rare*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/potion-of-invisibility.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

This potion's container looks empty but feels as though it holds liquid. When you drink the potion, you have the [Invisible](conditions.md#Invisible) condition for 1 hour. The effect ends early if you make an attack roll, deal damage, or cast a spell.
