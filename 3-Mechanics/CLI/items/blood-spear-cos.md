Kavan was a ruthless chieftain whose tribe lived in the Balinok Mountains centuries before the arrival of [Strahd von Zarovich](NPCs/NPC%20Files/npc/NPC%20Stats/strahd-von-zarovich-cos.md). Although he was very much alive, Kavan had some traits in common with vampires: he slept during the day and hunted at night, he drank the blood of his prey, and he lived underground. In battle, he wielded a spear stained with blood. His was the first blood spear, a weapon that drains life from those it kills and transfers that life to its wielder, imbuing that individual with the stamina to keep fighting.

When you hit with a melee attack using this magic spear and reduce the target to 0 hit points, you gain `dice:2d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d6`) temporary hit points.

Any creature can wield the spear, but only the character chosen by Kavan to wield it gains a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
