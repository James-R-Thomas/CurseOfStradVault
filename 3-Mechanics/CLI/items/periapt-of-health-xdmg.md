# Periapt of Health
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/periapt-of-health.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

While wearing this pendant, you can take a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action to regain `dice:2d4+2|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d4 + 2`) [Hit Points](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

In addition, you have [Advantage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on saving throws to avoid or end the [Poisoned](conditions.md#Poisoned) condition while you wear this pendant.
